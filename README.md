## DESCRIPTION: The  arithematic logic unit performs the basic operations like addition,subtraction,execution of AND,OR.NOT. In this code the inputs taken are a and b with which the basic operations like addition-a+b and subtraction- a-b and execution of AND- a&b,OR= a|b, NOT-~a (or ~b).For this verilog code in data flow modeling is taken.opcode is 3-bit control signal to select the operation.a and b are 4-bit inputs for arithmetic and logical operations.result is 4-bit output containing the result of the selected operation.result is 4-bit output containing the result of the selected operation.Addition (opcode = 000)-Computes a + b, with a carry.Subtraction (opcode = 001)-Computes a - b.AND (opcode = 010)-Bitwise AND of a and b.OR (opcode = 011)-Bitwise OR of a and b.NOT (opcode = 100)-Bitwise NOT of a.
